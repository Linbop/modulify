# How it works ?

Modulify has the following dependencies:

`esbuild` - build tool

`chokidar` - watch files and directories for changes and run build scripts on change

`fs-extra` - operations with files and directories (move, copy, remove etc.)

`yargs` - CLI argument parsing

`chalk` - colorful console logging

`shelljs` - implementation of Unix shell commands on top of the Node.js API
